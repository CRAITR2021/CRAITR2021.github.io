The Alarm Clock Radio
</h1>
<h2>
Basic Knowledge (Before Research)
</h2>
<p>
Alarm clock radios are a bit complicated,
in the fact that they are mainly circuit boards. 
We do know that the speakers have decently strong magnet,
which, when put into our bin for parts, attracted
all of our screws that we pulled out. We can learn about what
this magnet does, but for now, the other parts of the radio.
You see, in the radio you have a large circuit board, which receives 
the signal required for the radio portion. On this circuit board,
we have the diodes. These also house the switches
and pressure pads that act as buttons. These buttons do things like set
the time and other various, similar things.

<h2>
What We Learned After Research
</h2>
<p>
After we researched the alarm clock's
functionality more, we found that the magnets
inside of the clock's speakers sort of help
the sound of the radio resonate,
amplifying it so it can be heard better.
If the magnets were not there, then
you wouldn't be able to hear the signal.
The face of the alarm clock, that shows the time,
is made of L.E.D. lights, which stands for light
emitting diode. The buttons on the the front of the 
alarm clock do various things such as:
<ul>
<li>Set the time.</li>
<li>Set the alarm.</li>
<li>Turn on/off the alarm.</li>
</ul>
And other things of that sort, all about time, which
is the main function of the alarm. These are the main functions
of the Alarm Clock. The various, complicated parts of the clock are present
on the main circuit board, like the diodes, which convert the AC power to DC power.
Connected to the circuit board is a set of trigger pads which are pushed by the buttons,
which are really just plastic ovals attached to rods that push the pads down. The face 
of the clock, the L.E.D.'s, are also connected to the main circuit board, which has the
mechanics to show what time it is. Inside the speakers	 there are there to control what
people hear. If they weren't there, you wouldn't be able to hear a thing.

The Blow Dryer
</h1>
<h2>
Basic Knowledge (Before Research)
</h2>
<p>
We found that within the hair dryer,
there is a large coil of springs, around what looks like
a cardboard-like material, with rivets in the side, for
the spring coil to lock into, so that it stays in place. This
whole structure is wrapped in a slightly thinner, but similar
material to protect the outer plastic of the blow dryer from
melting. The inner mechanics of the blow dryer also contain
a copper wire wrapped tightly around a rod of some sort, that
connects to the fan. The fan also has a proective dome of sorts,
in the form of a tough, metal casing.

<h2>
What We Learned After Research
</h2>
<p>
After the dismantling of the blow dryer, we looked into various parts of it more.
We started with the plug itself. Inside of the large, box shaped plug, there was
a capacitator, with the simple purpose of storing a charge, and releasing it. 
There was also a resistor, which resists, or slows, the flow of the current. It's 
other purpose is to protect certain parts of the plug. The second part we inspected more,
the large coil of springs, it's true name being microme wire, which are used as a massive resistor.
When electricity flows through it, the current slows. The wire also doesn't oxidize, which
means it doesn't rust, at all. Around said wire is a tubing called a mica sheet. The sheet
protects the plastic of the body in a way so that it doesnt melt. It also protects the wire. But
the most integral part of the blow dryer is the fan. This fan is attached to a motor, which spins it,
as one would expect. Inside the motor is tangle of copper wire wrapped around the motor,
which also helps to heat up the air.
